First, I need to identify the table that illustrates the estimated amortization expenses from 2017 onwards. It looks like this table is super important in figuring out the expense for 2017. \\n\\nOkay, found it! The table clearly states that the estimated amortization expense for the year 2017 is $10,509, but it notes that this is in thousands. \\n\\nLet me think for a second. If the numbers are in thousands, that means I need to convert that $10,509 into actual dollars, which becomes $10,509,000. Easy enough, I just multiply by a thousand. \\n\\nI need to make sure this is consistent throughout. Let me double-check if there's any other information that throws a wrench in this conversion... Nope, everything seems straightforward here. \\n\\nSo, what's the conclusion? The amortization expense for 2017 is a clear-cut $10,509,000. Hmm, that makes sense based on the conversion from thousands of dollars, and it looks like there aren't any surprise twists or exceptions here. \\n\\nBut hold up, let me consider the perspective of portions. The context refers to percentages or parts, and for that, I should be thinking about the total amortization expense. The whole amount listed is $58,370,000 for all the intangible assets. \\n\\nTo find out what part of the total this 2017 expense represents, I'll calculate a ratio. So, I divide $10,509,000 by the grand total, $58,370,000. Crunching these numbers gives me around 0.18004.\\n\\nSo, in conclusion, the portion of the total estimated amortization expense that is specifically for 2017 is approximately 0.18004 of the total. I'm confident that's correct since that ratio aligns perfectly with the expectation of finding a portion or part. \\n\\nPhew, that should do it!\\n</think>\\nTo determine the portion of the estimated amortization expense that will be recognized in 2017, we first examine the table provided. The estimated amortization expense for 2017 is $10,509,000 (noting that the figures are in thousands, hence $10,509 becomes $10,509,000). \\n\\nThe total estimated amortization expense for all the listed years is $58,370,000. To find out what portion of the total this represents for 2017, we take the 2017 expense and divide it by the total:\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\text{Portion for 2017} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{2017 expense}}{\\\\text{Total expense}} = \\\\frac{10,509,000}{58,370,000} \\\\approx 0.18004 \\\\]\\n\\nTherefore, approximately 18.004% of the total estimated amortization expense will be recognized in 2017.<eos>\\n\""
